## Introduction

I'm a self-motivated and dedicated computer programmer, currently attending the 
Deep Dive Coding Java + Android Bootcamp. I excel at learning new computer
technologies, including programming languages, operating systems, and software
of all kinds. Known for a meticulous work style, excellent communication skills,
and a flexible approach to problem solving, I will be seeking
employment in Java enterprise-level development as a junior software engineer
upon graduation.
